This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-race package, an GNU R
implementation of some racing methods for the empirical selection of
the best. 
The package is written and maintained by Mauro Birattari <mbiro@ulb.ac.be>

The package was originally released as a CRAN package. It was renamed
from its upstream name 'race' to 'r-cran-race' to fit the pattern of
CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for R.
