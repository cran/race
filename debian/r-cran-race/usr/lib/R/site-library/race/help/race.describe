     This function may be provided by the user for giving a description
     of a candidate. It's definition has to be given in the same file
     in which the functions 'race.wrapper' and 'race.info' are defined.
     The name of such file has to be passed as first argument to the
     function 'race'.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     race.describe(candidate,data)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

candidate: The candidate for which a description is to be returned.

    data: It is the object of type 'list' (possibly empty) returned by
          'race.init', if the latter is defined by the user.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The function 'race.describe' should return an object describing
     the selected candidate. Such object will be printed by 'race'
     through the function 'print'.
