_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function is to be provided by the user. It's definition has
     to be given (together with the one of 'race.wrapper') in a file,
     and the name of such file has to be passed as first argument to
     the function 'race'.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     race.info(data)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    data: It is the object of type 'list' (possibly empty) returned by
          'race.init', if the latter is defined by the user.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The function 'race.info' is expected to return a list including
     the following components:

race.name: The name of the race for documentation purposes.

no.candidates: The number of candidates in the race.

no.tasks: Number of tasks available for testing.

no.subtasks: Each task might consists of 'no.subtasks'  subtasks. If
          the element 'no.subtasks' is not included in the list, it is
          assumed that each task is indeed atomic, that is,
          'no.subtasks=1'. 'no.subtasks' may also be a vector of length
          'no.tasks'. In this case, the i-th task  consists of
          'no.subtasks[i]' subtasks.

   extra: A character string providing extra information on the race
          for documentation purposes. It can be a long string and the
          user is not required to introduce newline characters: it will
          be automatically formatted for pretty-printing.
